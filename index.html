        On December, the 21st I awoke unsure of what to expect out of the day.  Another day filled with wonder about what may be around the next turn.  I met a friend for lunch at Tacolicious in the Mission district of SF.  I will never forget how that lunch could motivate me to take such a large risk and dip into the icy cold waters of spontaneity.  My friend told me he was taking a trip to London and was going to be gone for the first week of the year.  Not long after telling me, I decided to ask if he wanted a traveling companion.  To my surprise, he said yes!  I went home that afternoon and looked at some flights and hotel bookings to gauge what it would take to make this work.  I was soon filled with that ever so common fear of change.  I began to contemplate - who am I to take such a risk and leave the country on such short notice.  I had a passport, but I had never been out of the United States.  The furthest I had gone was Hawaii and that was only last Summer.  I decided to cave in to the fear and let go the idea of a trip abroad.  Some other day…that is what I have been telling myself my whole life – about a lot of things.  Later that evening my friend contacted me with some uplifting news about some options that could make my trip more within reach.  I spent that evening go back and forth between a couple of travel agents, discount travel websites, and British Airways.  I finally took the plunge and pushed the button on the flight.  WOW!!! What a risk that was for me to take.  I knew at that point in time there was a small window to escape, a chicken exit if you will, but I chose to push on.

        On the first day of the new year I set out on a 11-hour flight from San Francisco to the UK.  It was the longest I had ever flown before making it a true test of patience and stamina as I was unable to sleep on the overnight flight.  Arriving in Heathrow with an 8-hour time change I joined my companion on our journey to London proper to settle into our hotels.  As he was booked in Mayfair and I in Westminster I chose to walk with my luggage across Green Park past Buckingham Palace and through the dark alleys and streets of Westminster on a cold Monday evening.  After an adventurous perusal of the different alleys and streets of Westminster I found my hotel, St. Ermin’s Hotel, which would become my home away from home for the next 9 nights.  After settling in, I set out for some local food at The Feathers, a pub with burgundy leather booths, a block away where I had my first experience with Gloucester Old Spot Sausages.  Exhausted I went back to the hotel and crashed.

        I awoke at 4 am local time to begin the experience of Jet lag.  Yes, Jet lag is real and terribly hard on the body when traveling East through several time zones.  The next day began an adventure with my companion where we began assessing out sightseeing options for the next week.  I began, what I would find later, to be a daily ritual of walking several miles perusing the sights, architecture, people and culture of London.  I would eventually graduate to using the Tube and became rather adept and finding my way through the maze of lines from Victoria, to District, to Circle and Piccadilly.  Over the next week I would take turns on solo adventures alternating with excursions with my companion as I mapped out the beauty and wonder of London.  One of the highlights was a morning stroll through the greenery of parks connected by the Princess Diana Memorial Walk.  This allowed the opportunity to see the vast array of water fowl settled in along the ponds found throughout St. James Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, and the Kensington Gardens.  My friend and I explored throughout the London area dining at Trishna, Harrods, Princi on Wardour street and Bill’s on Baker street.  We finished our last day together getting some perspective via the views of the London Eye and a stroll through the London Zoo.
