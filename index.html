        On December, the 21st I awoke unsure of what to expect out of the day.  Another day filled with wonder about what may be around the next turn.  I met a friend for lunch at Tacolicious in the Mission district of SF.  I will never forget how that lunch could motivate me to take such a large risk and dip into the icy cold waters of spontaneity.  My friend told me he was taking a trip to London and was going to be gone for the first week of the year.  Not long after telling me, I decided to ask if he wanted a traveling companion.  To my surprise, he said yes!  I went home that afternoon and looked at some flights and hotel bookings to gauge what it would take to make this work.  I was soon filled with that ever so common fear of change.  I began to contemplate - who am I to take such a risk and leave the country on such short notice.  I had a passport, but I had never been out of the United States.  The furthest I had gone was Hawaii and that was only last Summer.  I decided to cave in to the fear and let go the idea of a trip abroad.  Some other day…that is what I have been telling myself my whole life – about a lot of things.  Later that evening my friend contacted me with some uplifting news about some options that could make my trip more within reach.  I spent that evening go back and forth between a couple of travel agents, discount travel websites, and British Airways.  I finally took the plunge and pushed the button on the flight.  WOW!!! What a risk that was for me to take.  I knew at that point in time there was a small window to escape, a chicken exit if you will, but I chose to push on.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the first day of the new year I set out on a 11-hour flight from San Francisco to the UK.  It was the longest I had ever flown before making it a true test of patience and stamina as I was unable to sleep on the overnight flight.  Arriving in Heathrow with an 8-hour time change I joined my companion on our journey to London proper to settle into our hotels.  As he was booked in Mayfair and I in Westminster I chose to walk with my luggage across Green Park past Buckingham Palace and through the dark alleys and streets of Westminster on a cold Monday evening.  After an adventurous perusal of the different alleys and streets of Westminster I found my hotel, St. Ermin’s Hotel, which would become my home away from home for the next 9 nights.  After settling in, I set out for some local food at The Feathers, a pub with burgundy leather booths, a block away where I had my first experience with Gloucester Old Spot Sausages.  Exhausted I went back to the hotel and crashed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I awoke at 4 am local time to begin the experience of Jet lag.  Yes, Jet lag is real and terribly hard on the body when traveling East through several time zones.  The next day began an adventure with my companion where we began assessing out sightseeing options for the next week.  I began, what I would find later, to be a daily ritual of walking several miles perusing the sights, architecture, people and culture of London.  I would eventually graduate to using the Tube and became rather adept and finding my way through the maze of lines from Victoria, to District, to Circle and Piccadilly.  Over the next week I would take turns on solo adventures alternating with excursions with my companion as I mapped out the beauty and wonder of London.  One of the highlights was a morning stroll through the greenery of parks connected by the Princess Diana Memorial Walk.  This allowed the opportunity to see the vast array of water fowl settled in along the ponds found throughout St. James Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, and the Kensington Gardens.  My friend and I explored throughout the London area dining at Trishna, Harrods, Princi on Wardour street and Bill’s on Baker street.  We finished our last day together getting some perspective via the views of the London Eye and a stroll through the London Zoo.

      The adventure took a spontaneous turn on the night of the 6th of January.  I knew my companion was leaving a few days before I was scheduled to depart and I was unsure as to what I would do with the time alone.  That evening as I sat in my hotel room I considered Paris and realized that I had never been this close in proximity.  With only the push of a button, a wave of clarity and a boost of courage I booked a train ride from St. Pancras International in London to Gare du Nord in Paris.  I could find a hotel a block from the Louvre for a reasonable price.  Due to the affordability of only spending one night, a Sunday, I chose to only spend 32 hours in Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
      My night in Paris was an unforgettable journey into the city of lights.  People often say it is always best to travel in the Summer time with the warm weather.  However, in the cool nights of January there are no crowds and the lights come on before the clock strikes 6.  This opened the gateway to an amazing trip down the Seine river after watching the Eiffel tower light up with all its glory.  At one point, I left the boat trip on the Seine to journey over to Notre-Dame and look inside.  Baptized a Catholic who completed Confirmation, I was amazed at what I walked into.  I expected to be overwhelmed with a masterpiece of French Gothic architecture.  Without paying attention to the time or the day, I had inadvertently walked into the movement of a mass of people going inside.  As if drawn by some power, I followed inside and found myself sitting in one of the pews.  About ten minutes later Mass began, and I found myself humbled by the awe and majesty of the service.  Although I didn’t know any French the service seemed like those I had attended growing up.  Afterwards I jumped back on the boat trip up the Seine river.  I left at the Champs-Elysees stop and began my stroll up the brightly lit avenue of Champs-Elysees.  I ended up the night by capturing the pyramid of the Louvre in all its nighttime beauty.  After an exhausting day, I fell asleep soundly with the dream of spending the following day at the Louvre.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Louvre was an experience that I had not expected.  I woke up early and took a morning walk with my coffee through the Jardin des Tuileries.  I was reminded, again, how wondrous the experience was in January as I had the Garden all to myself except for a handful of workers and an occasional commuter on their way to work.  Afterwards, I checked out of my hotel and began my journey through the Louvre Museum.  As it was early on a Monday morning and I had my ticket in hand, I could walk right in.  I locked up my backpack and made my way straight to the Monna Lisa.  Smaller than I had expected, she still captured me.  I knew I would make it back a few more times that day.  I never expected the feeling I had as I walked by the Coronation of Napoleon.  I was immediately stopped mid-step and was almost forced to sit down and enjoy the moment.  That was indicative of a lot of the trip overall.  One moment I would be moving along in full speed absorbing as much as possible when something would move me to the point that I knew I had to be mindful and stop and absorb the moment.  I would continue to have many more of this present moment mindful experiences throughout the day and on through the rest of the week.  I would find myself back at the painting by Jacques-Louis David a few more times that day.  The overall experience of the Louvre was more than I expected as there were floors dedicated to antiquities, levels representing historic floor designs, and the basement floor which housed the historical context of how the Louvre originated as a Palace before it evolved into the majestic museum it is today.  After five hours, I became exhausted from the journey through the labyrinth of the Louvre and resigned myself to call the end to the journey.  Although I knew I needed more time to absorb all that was offered, I also knew I would return some day.  Afterwards I made my way of to the Notre-Dame for one more moment to honor my Mother before I made the walk up to the train station to head back to London.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day would begin another moment of clarity in regards to my Carpe Diem journey.  I realized that San Francisco was experiencing a deluge of a rain storm.  The likelihood of my flight being cancelled or re-routed grew exponentially.  Although I didn’t need much of a push I decided to use that as an excuse to pursue another dream.  I contacted British Airways and realized for only the cost of a change fee I could delay my flight home one more week.

      <p>
      After changing my flight, I checked around at some ideas.  I thought about going back to Paris, but the cost of a week there seemed out of my range (although I lost sight of what that was).  I eventually considered Rome and found an amazing deal on a flight from Heathrow roundtrip for next to nothing.  I immediately booked a flight and 6 nights and set my sails for Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next day I woke up at 4am and grabbed an Uber ride out to Heathrow to prepare for a 7am flight out to Rome.  The flight was a beautiful 2 ½ hour flight over Europe surrounded by sunshine.  The flight ended with an amazing stretch over the Alps before we began our descent into Rome.  Upon landing I was thrust into the world of another language and fear began to set in.  I was overwhelmed with offers by taxi drivers and other so-called services to assist me in getting to my hotel.  Fortunately, I have an adept skill at asking for help and a young lady at the train station showed me how to take the trains, where to transfer, and where to depart for only an 8-euro ticket.  Everything she detailed worked out perfectly and my transfer involved me running to another station where my train was right there waiting for me.  I took it as a sign that I was meant to make the most out of my first day in Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
      I was able to check in early and with my new-found confidence in the local public transportation I set out to take a train back to the heart of Rome.  I transferred to the city metro underground rail subway and jetted over to the first of many exits I would become familiar with called Barberinni.  From there I set out for my first day exploring Rome.  I ventured around and realized the meandering roads could lead be me down a different set of Tratorrias, Pastacerrias, Cafes, and vendors.  I remember taking a turn and inadvertently stumbling into the Fontana de Trevi, an architectural masterpiece that happens to be the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world.  From there I continued my wanderlust for taking turns without consulting a map.  Eventually I took this staircase that dropped me into the Foro di Augusto, an imperial forum built by Augustus.  After capturing the Forum from several camera angles, I continued down the stretch of road that unfolded before me.  Before long I was breath taken at what laid before me, The Coliseum.
      </p>
      <p>
      I was able walk right into the Coliseum without a wait and wandered around with next to no crowds or people to contend with.  Although it was a beautiful sunny day, it was still early January and late in the afternoon of a Wednesday so the swarms of people were nowhere to be found.  After touring the Coliseum, I still had plenty of daylight left so I continued back the way I came to see what this large building was I noticed by the Augustus Forum.  It turned out to be Altare della Patria and provided some beautiful snapshots, although I found out later it has some poor history with Romans for its proximity to the Roman forum and poor choice of architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
      After that I found some solace in a Ristorante with some food and heat lamps.  As the sun set and the moon came out, I was energized to revisit this same sites for some beautiful nighttime shots and soaked in the magical aura that penetrates the columnar structures in the nightlight.  I continued my nighttime adventure of Rome and came across such beautiful places as the Pantheon, the River Tiber, Castel Sant’Angelo, and St. Peter’s square.  Feeling complete I headed back to my hotel after an amazing first day in Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next morning, I set out for the Vatican Museum and I was pleased yet again to find no line to content with as I could walk right in.  I was so set on seeing the Sistine chapel that I moved through the museum with such speed and anticipation and I never paused to enjoy the moment.  When I arrived at the Sistine chapel, I felt an overwhelming sense of pause and a moment of clarity told me I need to redo this experience.  I set out to retrace my steps and walked through the museum again, but with a slower pace and mindful of the moment.  This experience allowed me to appreciate the majesty of the sculptures, tapestries, and the beautiful maps in the Gallery of Maps.  After I arrived a second time in the Sistine chapel, I took the time to sit and pray.  Not more than five minutes after sitting one of the security set up a microphone and emphasized the need for silenzio.  I was amazed when a bishop in a black robe came out and spoke to the crowd.  He began a prayer with everyone in Italian and repeated it in several different languages including English.  I was humbled by the experience and realized yet again how grateful I am I took the time to pause and be mindful of the present moment.  I sat in the chapel for several minutes after that taking different places to sit and meditate on Michelangelo’s masterpieces, The Last Judgement and The Creation of Adam, as well as the other works on the ceiling and walls by Perugino and Boticelli.  I thought of going to St. Peter’s Basilica, but by that time there was a line that stretched to the end of St. Peter’s square to gain passage past security.  Since the afternoon was overcast I spent the time perusing various basilicas throughout Rome and taking the time to pray and meditate.
      </p>
      <p>
      Friday morning, I went to St. Peter’s Basilica first thing and I was fortunate to make it through security in under twenty minutes.  I made my way to the top of the cupola which involved 551 steps to the top.  After the first 320, I paused to take in the wonder of view of the gallery from inside the dome.  The final journey involved this narrow curving staircase that brings you out into this awe-inspiring view of Rome and Vatican City.  After spending some time soaking in the splendor of Rome and the beauty of Vatican City, I made my way into the gallery.  I was wandering around when I found small group of people in prayer at one of the chapels.  I felt compelled to sit down and pray.  Within minutes I realized mass was about to begin and I felt the desire to stay and take part.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Afterwards I left to find another church, St. Paul’s, where I could find my true companions in spirituality and listened as we took part in our Daily Reflection and read a chapter from Came to Believe.  I met some people from Berlin, Dublin, and America.]
      </p>
      <p>
      After the meeting, I went to venture out to Basilica di San Giovanni di Laterno which is the first church of Christ and the official cathedral church of Rome.  [Later that evening, after an afternoon at a café, I went back to the St. Paul’s and met with my fellows for an evening reading on chapter 3.]  I met some more amazing fellows who were traveling as well as local.  Three women and I went out for dinner at an amazing restaurant – Trattoria Valentino del Boshetto where had the most amazing dish of Lasagna.  I ended up a wonderful Friday in Rome with a walk to Piazza della Repubblica with an amazing New York woman and a glowing moonlit night.
      </p>
      <p>
      Saturday, I awoke to Rome being bathed in sunlight.  I set out to see the ancient Foro Romano, the political, religious and commercial center of Ancient Rome.  Over 6 centuries of architectural legacy still stood to tell the story of the evolution of culture.  I was initially overwhelmed by my first experience of dealing with large crowds and lines.  That’s what happens on a sunny Saturday in Italy’s biggest tourist destination.  I managed the line and with my ticket in hand I began my quest through the Roman Forum.  I was overtaken by the sheer magnitude of the area encompassed by the Forum.  Thankful for an early start, I began my meandering through vast array of ruins and architecture including the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome. After a couple of hours of breath-taking photos with a sunlit blue sky as a background, I made my way up to Palantino.  The Palantine hill looms over the Forum at the center of the Seven Hills of Rome and is one of the most ancient parts of city.  Here I found the birthplace of Augustus, known as the Palatine House.  The historical significance of this region lays out the map to the beginning of Roman history.
      </p>
      <p>
      Following a morning and perusing the ruins of the Rome I would take the elevator to the top of the Altare della Patria.  This outlook provides the most majestic views of all of Rome extending well beyond to the regional mountain landscapes.  I continued my afternoon by walking by the Trevi Fountain again on my way to Piazza Spagna and the famed Spanish Steps.  After walking up and down the historic pathway that connects the Villa Medici with the Piazza Spagna with 135 steps, I paused to talk in the photography of a young couple who had recently married.  I concluded my sunny Saturday in Rome with a walk over to Piazza Navona and a prayer in Sant'Agnese in Agone.  Exhausted from the long day I made my way back to my hotel to retire from the beautiful day.
      </p>
      <p>
      Sunday began with a desire to see the Pope’s angelus message, a weekly Sunday noon sharing of the Pope from his apartment window to the masses of people collected in St. Peter’s square.  Arriving early, I decided to head into St. Peter’s Basilica to recapture the experience of majestic art.  I soon realized that mass was beginning in the main chapel.  I watched the first few minutes with the crowd on the outside barrier before I found myself compelled to request to join the Mass.  I was humbled by the experience and words cannot fully express the spiritual experience from attending Sunday Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica.  After the conclusion of Mass I followed the throng of people out to the square to find a spot to watch the Pope’s angelus message.  There were several huge, at least 15 feet tall, Panasonic monitors to display zoomed portrayals of the Pope as he spoke in Italian.  The message, although in Italian, was a rare experience I will not soon forget.
      </p>
      <p>
      Afterwards, I made my way towards the Spanish steps.  I met up with Carla, a friend I met on Friday, at a café.  She convinced me I needed to try some chocolate and we selected some cones from Cioccogelateria Venchi.  Wow, what an amazing blast of joy to the taste buds.  We meandered the streets of Rome past the Marcus Aurelius column to the Capitoline Museums.  Here stood the infamous statues of Marcus Aurelius and She-wolf of Rome.  We spent the afternoon perusing the statues, paintings, and majestic views of the Roman Forum.  After having a cappuccino on the deck of the museum out looking over Rome, I made my way back to the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
      On Monday, I concluded my journey in Rome with a morning walk through the largest park in Rome, the Villa Borghese.  I made another final round of views of the Pantheon, Colosseum, and Roman Forum before resigning from worn out legs and feet.  I am not sure how many miles I logged, but estimates put it at around 3-5 a day over the two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tuesday, I made it back to the Airport via the Leondardo Da Vinci express train and sent arrivederci to the beautiful city of Rome.
